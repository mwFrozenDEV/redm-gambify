A .bat Script that will create your own custom RedM settings/system.xml file for PvP Purposes. 

How To Use:

Copy the raw code from gambify.bat, create a txt file inside a folder (Make Sure there are no Spaces in the Path! Currently doesnt work if Spaces in Path!), rename it to gambify.bat and run it. The rest is explained in the cmd.

It will copy your current config and manipulate it.

Current Features:

Main Menu tells you if your Main or Alternative Config is loaded.

Integrated RedM Config Editor. (Main Menu -> 1)

You can quickly swap between 2 different configs using this tool. (Main Menu -> 2)

Go through initial configuration for the file paths. (Main Menu -> 3)

Show current configuration for the file paths. (Main Menu -> 4)

Create a Shortcut on your Desktop and optionally in the Start Menu with a custom made logo. (Main Menu -> 5)

Using the settings inside the Editor might double or tripple your FPS.
